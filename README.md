# Dribble_o_Mat
A plate, on whitch you can dribble in a specific time and it count how many times.

## Idea
The system should be modulare based on a bus system, so that i can later create some auxiliary, like a huge 7-Segment display or an adittional 'Start' button.

## Used Librarys
Mainly I use my own [library](https://github.com/Manfe07/RS485_Ardunio-library) for the communication over the RS485-Bus.
